## Blogging with Hugo

This is the first blog post that I've created with [Hugo](https:/www.hugo.io).
I have to say that I'm very satisfied with it. It is a publicly available in [GitHub](https://www.github.com/noloman/noloman.github.io) along with my website. It is automatically deployed with [Netlify] every time I push to the public Github repo and the configuration process has been easy and fast.
All the configuration needed for Netlify is [here](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/), and of course, there are two things I really love about it:
  - It is completely FREE
  - There are thousands of excellent and beautiful available themes that are very easy to set up.
However, I also find it quite daunting to be able to properly configure the blog, as Hugo seems to have A LOT of customization options. Thankfully, they have it all [documented quite nicely](https://gohugo.io/documentation/).

On the contrary, I have tried to setup a Jekyll blog and it really was painful to try to change the default theme while hosting it in Github Pages.
